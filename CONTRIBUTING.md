<summary>Ways to contribute :mag:</summary>
<br>

Stronghold is currently being regarded as feature complete, but we can't anticipate every future extension that might be useful or increases security. 

So in order to contribute to Stronghold on GitHub, you can:

- Report a bug
- Suggest a new feature as an RFC inside [discussions](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/discussions)
    - _note_ we have a iota-wide TIP process, which includes RFCs. Work in Stronghold specific RFC templates is in progress.

<summary>Report a bug :bug:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through reporting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand the bug, reproduce the behavior, and find related bugs.

### Before reporting a bug

Please check the following list:

- **Do not open a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities**, instead, please contact us at [security@iota.org](mailto:security@iota.org).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/issues). If the bug has already been reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting a bug report

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/issues/new), and be sure to include as many details as possible, using the template.

**Note:** Minor changes such as fixing a typo can but do not need an open issue.

If you also want to fix the bug, submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) and reference the issue.

<summary>Pull requests :mega:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through submitting a pull request (PR). Following these guidelines helps give your PR the best chance of being approved and merged.

### Before submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- A pull request should have exactly one concern (for example one feature or one bug). If a PR addresses more than one concern, it should be split into two or more PRs.

- A pull request can be merged only if it references an open issue

    **Note:** You don't need to open an issue for minor changes such as typos, but you can if you want.



Todo: Add project specific requirements like formatting, linting, tests, comments, license and so on


### Submitting a pull request

The following is a typical workflow for submitting a new pull request:


_note:_ You may add project specific steps and change the branch


1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch based on your fork. For example, `git checkout -b fix/my-fix` or ` git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
3. Commit changes and push them to your fork
4. Target your pull request to be merged with `develop`

If all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) pass, and the maintainer approves the PR, it will be merged.

**Note:** Reviewers may ask you to complete additional work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be approved and merged.
