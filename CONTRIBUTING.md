<summary>Ways to contribute :mag:</summary>
<br>

Stronghold is currently being regarded as feature complete, but we cannot anticipate every future extension that might be useful or increases security. 

So to contribute to Stronghold on GitHub, you can:

- Report a bug.
- Suggest a new feature as an RFC inside [discussions](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/discussions).
    - _note_ we have a iota-wide TIP process, which includes RFCs. Work in Stronghold specific RFC templates is in progress.

This section guides you through reporting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand the bug, reproduce the behavior, and find related bugs.

### Before reporting a bug

Please check the following list:

- **Do not open a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities**, instead, please contact us at [security@iota.org](mailto:security@iota.org).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/issues). If the bug has already been reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.


::: Note

If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting a Bug Report

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/issues/new), and be sure to include as many details as possible, using the template.

**Note:** Minor changes such as fixing a typo can but do not need an open issue.

If you also want to fix the bug, submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) and reference the issue.
