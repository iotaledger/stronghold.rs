## Introduction
[summary]: #summary

**IOTA Stronghold** is a secure software implementation with the sole purpose of isolating digital secrets from exposure to hackers and accidental leaks. It uses encrypted snapshots that can be easily backed up and securely shared between devices. Written in stable rust, it has strong guarantees of memory safety and process integrity. 

There are three main components of Stronghold:
1. **Client**: The high-level interface to Stronghold (prefers Riker, functional integration also available)
2. **Engine**: Combines a persistence store (Snapshot) with an in-memory state interface (Vault), a read/write key:value system (Store) and memory protection services (Runtime).
3. **P2P-Communication**: Enables Strongholds in different processes or on different devices to communicate with each other securely.

## 3rd Party Independent Security Audit
In April of 2021, F-Secure performed a security assessment of the core crates of IOTA Stronghold and found nothing of concern. This is not an explicit declaration of fitness or freedom of error, but it is an indicator of the high quality of the code. You may review [the audit here](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/blob/dev/documentation/docs/meta/Audit.pdf).
