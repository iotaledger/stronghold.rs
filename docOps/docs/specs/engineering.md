## Summary
[summary]: #summary
This document introduces the High-Level Specification of the Stronghold.
## Logical System Design
[system-design]: #system-design

### Low Level
A Stronghold is composed of several interacting systems at a low level:

1. Snapshot - box-encrypted file-based persistence layer
2. Vault - a write and use protected, path-based system for storing and using secrets like private keys
3. Store - a read/write key:value storage system for dynamic data 
4. Cache - an in-memory abstraction for vault and store
5. Runtime - memory protection system for secrets
6. Communication - libp2p based system for communication between strongholds

### High Level
At the high level, Stronghold provides an official client for interfacing with a Stronghold snapshot and its records.
