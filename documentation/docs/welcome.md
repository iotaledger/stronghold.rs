# Welcome
Stronghold is an open-source software library that was originally built to protect IOTA Seeds, but can be used to protect any digital secret. 

It is a secure database for working with cryptography, which ensures that secrets (like private keys) are never revealed - but can be used according to best practices.

It provides its own peer-to-peer communication layer, so that different apps can securely communicate using the state-of-the-art Noise Protocol over libp2p.

## 3rd Party Independent Security Audit
In April of 2021, F-Secure performed a security assessment of the core crates of IOTA Stronghold and found nothing of concern. This is not an explicit declaration of fitness or freedom of error, but it is an indicator of the high quality of the code. You may review [the audit here](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/blob/dev/documentation/docs/meta/Audit.pdf).
