# Tutorials

A [tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is the most complex type of documentation you will have. They usually
require regular effort to maintain them, touch a variety of subjects and should guide the user in much more detail than
[How Tos](../how_tos/_README.mdx) or [Key Concepts](../key_concepts/README.md).

For more information on tutorials, please visit the [IOTA Wiki Tutorial template](https://github.com/iota-wiki/tutorial-template).
