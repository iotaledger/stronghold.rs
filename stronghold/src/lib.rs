//! ## Introduction
//!
//! IOTA Stronghold is a secure software implementation with the sole purpose of isolating digital secrets from exposure to hackers and accidental leaks. It uses versioned snapshots with double-encryption that can be easily backed up and securely shared between devices. Written in stable rust, it has strong guarantees of memory safety and process integrity. The high-level developer-friendly libraries will integrate the IOTA protocol and serve as a reference implementation for anyone looking for inspiration or best-in-class tooling.
//!
//! ## WARNING
//!
//! This library has not yet been audited for security, so use at your own peril. Until a formal third-party security audit has taken place, the IOTA Foundation makes no guarantees to the fitness of this library for any purposes.
//!
//! As such they are to be seen as experimental and not ready for real-world applications.
//!
//! Nevertheless, we are very interested in feedback about the design and implementation, and encourage you to reach out with any concerns or suggestions you may have.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
