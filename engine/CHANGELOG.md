- - Refactor Sink and Stream implementation for EventChannel

- Use `libp2p::swarm::toggle` to enable/ disable relay and mdns

- Make stronghold interface clonable
- Update inline Docs and README files to reflect the current state of the project.
- Add communication fuzzer for distributed fuzzing with docker.
- Patch Stronghold engine fuzzer.
- Patch crypto.rs version v0.7 -> v0.8.
- Persist the state of stronghold-p2p in the `SecureClient` by serializing the `NetworkConfig` and writing it to the store.
- Allow loading stored states into the `NetworkActor` on init.
- Allow reuse of same `Keypair` that is stored in the vault.
- Software transactional memory framework as replacement for actix actor system
- Integration is runtime agnostic an can be used by any async runtime for rust, tkio is encouraged though
- Extract `random` functions from `test_utils` into own module.

- Introduce KeyProvider instead of repeatedly providing a passphrase.
- Introduce non-contiguous memory types for secure key handling.
- Abstract over locked and encrypted data types for use internally.
