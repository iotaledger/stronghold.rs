//! Vault is an in-memory database specification which is designed to work without a central server. Only the user which
//! holds the associated id and key may modify the data in a vault.  Another owner can take control over the data if
//! they know the id and the key.
//!
//! Data can be added to the chain via a `DataTransaction`.  The `DataTransaction` is associated to the chain
//! through the owner's ID and it contains its own randomly generated ID.
//!
//! Records may also be revoked from the Vault through a `RevocationTransaction`. A `RevocationTransaction` is
//! created and it references the id of a existing `DataTransaction`. The `RevocationTransaction` stages the
//! associated record for deletion. The record is deleted when the [`DbView`] preforms a garbage collection and the
//! `RevocationTransaction` is deleted along with it.
