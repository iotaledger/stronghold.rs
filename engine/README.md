## engine

Engine is the collection of low-level crates with which application architects can build higher-level implementations of Strongholds for a variety of purposes. It is platform agnostic, in that it should run anywhere a Rust Compiler will work.

It is composed of 4 primary crates:
- snapshot
- vault
- store
- runtime
